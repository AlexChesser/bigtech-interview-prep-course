# coding-interview-practice

For any code games out there, I prefer to work in my preferred IDE and paste in the solution. In order to preserve the work and share with potentially interested people I'm posting my work publicly.

## how to use this repository

### As a hiring manager

One possible use of this code repository is to pre-evaluate the algorithm practise I've done. Within each folder under challenges is a separate coding test. You can within github online look at the coding history tab to view the final code as well as the commits that got me there.

### As a student

**Update**: I've found an incredible guide on studying for the big tech code interview which comes with a 14 week plan. I've converted the original article into a spreadsheet that you can import into a Google calendar to set yourself on a self study course in prepping for your next big move.

Note: you can now import the study guide into Google calendar and go at your own pace. https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PVcO4PfAp3Y9God8opvqXYntc_oU4x1beZ4UTv1juAI/edit?usp=sharing

I'll be streaming weekly meet-ups and discussion groups on http://twitch.tv/lgtm_shipit they'll probably also get uploaded to YouTube as well so you can follow along asynchronously. There will be more lesson plan development and homework! So please join me. We're learning together here and I'll need your help!

Take the time to go through the interview study guide planning document to get a sense of the overall flow. Structure will have a recommneded path towards studying broken out into chapters of mastery. After which hopefully you will be ready to take a coding interview.

I have every expeactions from the reading I've done that this can take from 4 months to a year to complete.
