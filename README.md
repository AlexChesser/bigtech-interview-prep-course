# coding-interview-practice

For any code games out there, I prefer to work in my preferred IDE and paste in the solution. In order to preserve the work and share with potentially interested people I'm posting my work publicly.

## how to use this repository

### As a hiring manager

One possible use of this code repository is to pre-evaluate the algorithm practise I've done. Within each folder under challenges is a separate coding test. You can within github online look at the coding history tab to view the final code as well as the commits that got me there.

### As a student

Take the time to go through the interview study guide planning document to get a sense of the overall flow. Structure will have a recommneded path towards studying broken out into chapters of mastery. After which hopefully you will be ready to take a coding interview.

I have every expeactions from the reading I've done that this can take from 4 months to a year to complete.
