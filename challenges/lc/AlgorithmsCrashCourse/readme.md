# Leetcode Study Plans

## [Algorithms I](https://leetcode.com/study-plan/algorithm/?progress=oak7om3)

### Day 01 - Binary Search

- Wrote three Binary Search problems (easy)
- Solving a binary search three ways quickly was a nice way to understand the comonalities between binary searches
- Efficient BS split the full set of data by 2 on each iteration
- They carry a pointer to the LOW number and the HIGH number while carrying a third pointer at the current midpoint
- A while loop tends to be most efficient, though for some solutions recursion might result in less code, they appear to use more memory
- Exiting the while loop requires updating the low and high on each iteration and quitting when you either find your value or meet in the middle.

**Problems**

- `704. Binary Search`
- `278. First Bad Version`
- `35. Search Insert Position`
