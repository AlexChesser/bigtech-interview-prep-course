# Professional Self Reflection Questions

## Purpose

Consider what external factors
or trends are affecting your professional
practice. The outcomes are your shortterm (1 to 3 years) and long-term (3 to 5
years) goals.

Reflect on where you are in your career
and where you would like to be in the
future. This becomes a critical first step
in planning for continuing professional
development and career management.

Self-reflection will clarify where you
are now and where you want to go. You
can then position yourself to achieve
your desired level of proficiency through
establishing short-term and long-term
goals.
