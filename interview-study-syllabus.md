# Self study course guide

This document is a work in progress and will contain all material related to a recommended study pathway to go from experienced coder to FAANG interview passing megastar.

## external resources

* **[codinginterview.com](https://www.codinginterview.com/)**: This appears to be a pretty slick website with infographic type sumamries of the coding interviews for various FAANG+ companies alongside detailed descriptions. Possibly the best, first resource for the grind of passing a FAANG+ interview process.

* Seriously - this roadmap is amazing! https://www.codinginterview.com/interview-roadmap

> If you do one thing, [use this roadmap](https://www.codinginterview.com/interview-roadmap)

* <https://github.com/anushka23g/Complete-Placement-Preparation>

This repo appears to have a number of PDFs that link to other pages. It's a little spammy feeling. Will probably delete this.

* [How to Get a Job at Google - Amazon - Facebook - or Microsoft in 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nODOtyHSBc)
Video includes basic tips on getting noticed, however there additionally some pretty interesting points about how to deliver messaging during the interview process. 

  * **IMPACT**: optimize your experience stories about impact, meaning. explain what you did and how important that thing was. Was the task a $10k change in profitablity or a $1M change? (tell stories about the big numbers)
  * **Interview flow**:
    1. phone screen: simple small chat
    1. assessment: coding test
    1. phone interview: 45 mintes to 1 hour background questions details about the resume.
    1. in person: 5 interviews 45 minutes each, no lunch :'(
  * 40 to 100 hours prep. You MUST study. Consider it a marathon it is a LOT of work.
  * **FOR CODING INTERVEW**:
    * know syntax of languages, java/python/ruby/go/C#?
      * Uber is known to hire across any language (reported in recent tech talk/hiring night)
    * know how memory mangement works
    * know common libraries and how THEY manage memory
    * Object Oriented Design
  * **Behavioral side**:
    * Expect to be asked about times when you have achieved something and made an impact
    * expect to have a good answer for "why should we hire you?"
    * **Culture** - make sure you know and understand the culture of the organization you are joining. For example, talk about how frugal you are at amazon.
    * prepare for thought experiment questions - how many footballs fit in a stadium? Work through the process of how you would solve the problem. For example maybe ask which stadium? Are the footballs inflated?  I honestly have no idea what to do with these questions!
  * **SAR**: Situation - Action - Result
  * Ask questions
  * Do not say "we" - make sure you talk about just the things you do. There's no "WE" in team.
  * make sure you talk through your coding problems out loud. In one example the interviewee said they didn't know how to solve the problem and got the job anyways, but working through the concept in real time. (practice the algos, but if you can't then work through)
  * understand the algo CONCEPT not memorization
  * Use data with behavioral questions
  * excitement - be sure they know you want the job
  * **THE BAR RAISER**: 4 of the 5 interviewers will be on your team while 1 will not be. This person will be in the room as an objective third party to ensure the team does not make mistakes in hiring.
  * **LEADERSHIP PRINCIPLES**: (AMAZON) <https://www.amazon.jobs/en/principles>
  * **Google**: 100% committee nobody on your team.
