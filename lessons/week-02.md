# WEEK 2: Underpinning Algorithms

The topics at hand for the next two weeks are: Complexity Analysis (a.k.a BigO), Arrays, Stacks, Queues, Linked List, Trees, Tries, Graphs (BFS and DFS), Hash Tables, Heaps, Sorting, Searching

## Learning Objectives

1. Know what topics are expected to arise during a code interview
1. Be aware of where to find resources on the expected topics
1. Understand Big-O notation
1. Be able to estimate Big-O by looking at an algorithm

## Discussion questions

1. O(log n) as the law of dimishing returns
1. HackerRank / Leetcode algorithm practise strategies based on learning theory
   TL;DR: Set a timer, solve without assistance for 30 minutes. If you haven't solved in time, look at the solution. Finish solving for another 30.
   (potentially) Reduce time allocation as you improve.
1. Time complexity and Space complexity - don't forget about memory

## Reading and Research

1. <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ee0HzlnIYWQ> 30 minute lecture - pragmatic big-O

### Hash Tables

1. <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shs0KM3wKv8> Gayle Laakmann McDowell 6 minute overview - good rule for interview questions, the answer is always a hash table

### How to use HackerRank/Leetcode

1. <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIrS31CCITM> Techlead: How to solve coding interview problems ("Let's leetcode")

## Homework

1. Solve 4 easy and 1 medium algorithm problem in HackerRank or Leetcode.
   Adjust for your skill level and avialable time.
