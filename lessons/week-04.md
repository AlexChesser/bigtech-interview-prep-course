# WEEK 4: Sorting

Trying to change the pace of learning. Deep diving on a single topic

## Learning Objectives

1. Learn insider information from Amy Miller <https://www.recruitinginyogapants.com/> tech recruiter who has worked directly with Google, Microsoft and, Amazon (kindof a big deal!)
2. Deep dive on the topic of sorting.

## Discussion questions

## Chatting with Amy Miller

> The structure of what I see as the recruitment process as a whole is

1. employer realizes need
1. recruiter does search
1. candidate gets contacted
1. candidate does the gauntlet:
    1. pre-screen ->
    1. tech-screen ->
    1. tech Quiz #1 ->
    1. BIG DAY tech marathon tech & behavioral exam
1. offer

> Our training course is really focusing on the tech side of things, learning our algos and data structures, but I figured there were a bunch of insights we could pick up from you as a tech recruiter for google, microsoft, (and now amazon?)

* What sorts of things do you see in candidates who you feel are most likely to succeed?
* Are there any major watch-outs you'd warn us about?
* How do we improve our discoverability as candidates?
* How do we negotiate the offer stage?
* Maybe some thoughts on "bootcamp to big tech"? We've got a few bootcampers and self educated developers so getting some guidance on living with imposter-syndrome might help ease the fears around "trying for the brass ring"

> I know you already have a tonne of content and may have answered these before on your channel, but part of the goal in getting a real live & successful recruiter to come online and interact in real time is to help humanize and pitch the recruiters as real-live interactive people who are actively "on your side" as a candidate.
> With some time to answer real questions from the audience I think it could be really helpful for the group!
