# WEEK 5: Algos in detail

As you are familiarizing (or re-familiarizing) yourself with data structures, start practicing relatively simple coding problems associated with these data structures and algorithms.

These questions are typically not asked in interviews at big tech companies. Even if they are, they’re usually used as fizz-buzz type warm-up problems. Such questions are also common during phone interviews. However, practicing these coding interview questions will help you internalize the data structures and help you tackle the harder questions which you’ll be practicing a few weeks from now.

**Brush up your array skills with questions like:**

* Remove Even Integers from Array - <https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-element/solution/>
* Merge Two Sorted Arrays
* First Non-Repeating Integer in an Array
* Find Second Maximum Value in an Array

**Brush up your Linked List concepts with questions like:**

* Find Length of Linked List
* Search in Singly Linked List
* Reverse a Linked List <https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-linked-list/solution/>
* Find Middle Value of Linked List

**Brush up your Stack/Queue skills with questions like:**

* Sort values in Stack
* Create Stack where min() returns minimum value in O(1)
* Implement Two Stacks using one Array

**Practice Tree Problems like:**

* Find minimum value in Binary Search Tree
* Find Height of Binary Tree
* Find kth maximum value in Binary Search Tree

**Practice Graph Problems:**

* Implement Breadth First Search
* Implement Depth First Search
* Detect cycle in Graph

**Practice basic Trie Problems:**

* Total number of words in Trie
* Find all words stored in Trie <https://leetcode.com/problems/implement-trie-prefix-tree/solution/>

**Practice basic Heap problems:**

* Find k smallest elements in a list <https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/k-largestor-smallest-elements-in-an-array/>
* Find k largest elements in an array
