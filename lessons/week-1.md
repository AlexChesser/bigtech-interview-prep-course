# WEEK 1: Feature learning & Scheduling self-reflection

This week has two main focuses.

The first, in following the study-gude & roadmap to take the time to learn the syntax of basic commands you might be faced with in your code interview. Other than a brief overview, the work on that front will have to be your own.

Once you acknoweldge that the learning has to happen, it's on you to just do it.

The second, delve deeper into the concept of professional self-reflection as a practice borrowed from teaching which I don't see discussed extensively in computer science & software engineering.
