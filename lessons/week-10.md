# WEEK 10: System Design Interviews

System design interviews are now an integral part of the software engineering interview process — particularly if you are applying for a senior role. These interviews have a significant impact on your “hiring level.”

Learn distributed systems concepts like Cap Theorem, Consistency, Partitioning, Load-Balancing etc.

Look at the course [Grokking the System Design Interview](https://www.educative.io/collection/5668639101419520/5649050225344512) for more design interview practice.

As part of your System Design Interviews, you are asked to design a “web-scale” service. Interviewers are interested in evaluating your ability to describe the different parts of a scale-able service, such as:

* How are web-servers load-balanced?
* How are databases shared?
* How are large files stored?
* How is the network set up for redundancy and maximum throughput?

**You’ll want to practice questions like:**

* Design Instagram
* Design Facebook Newsfeed
* Design Uber
