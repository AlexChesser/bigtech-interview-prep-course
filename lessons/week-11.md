# WEEK 11: OS and concurrency

Today, even “budget” laptops and mobile phone have multiple cores. Understanding concepts like Threads, Locks, Synchronization, etc. are beneficial whether you are building a mobile app or a web-scale service.

Just like System Design interview questions — Multi-Threading and Concurrency Interview questions are useful in gauging your level. A junior engineer will struggle with these questions (and are expected to learn more on the job). A relatively senior engineer is supposed to do better in such questions as they would be responsible for writing a lot of code that takes advantage of multiple cores/threads.

[Java Multithreading and Concurrency for Senior Engineering Interviews](https://www.educative.io/collection/5307417243942912/5707702298738688) is a good resource to check out for more guidance.

## Learning Objectives

1. Be able to define Concurrency, Threading, Parallelism
2. Be able to explain thread safety
3. Consider the "paralells" between threads on a CPU and large scale distributed systems (ha ha)
