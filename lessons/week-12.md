# WEEK 12: Object-oriented  design interviews

**Some common questions include:**

* Design an ATM
* Design an elevator
* Design a Parking System

In Object Oriented Design Questions, interviewers are looking for your understanding of Software Design Patterns and your ability to transform the requirements into comprehensible Classes. You spend most of your time explaining the various components, their interfaces and how different components interact with each other using the interfaces.
