# WEEK 13: Behavioral Interviews

This is the one that many think won’t matter, although this is the interview that sometimes matters the most. For example, at Amazon, culture is deeply rooted in their hiring process, where a “[Bar Raiser](https://www.aboutamazon.com/working-at-amazon/how-amazon-hires)” (someone who lives and breathes Amazon culture) can have the final say over you getting hired.

The thinking for that is quite simple: if you have the right attitude, you can learn new skills so minor shortcomings in your coding or system design interviews can be overlooked. However, if a person seems to be dispassionate about the product or doesn’t look like a team player, they are probably not worth hiring even if they are great hackers.

There’s also a famous book called The No Asshole Rule. Companies try not to hire people who can be toxic — the long-term cost of doing so can be enormous. Companies also don’t want to hire engineers who are not passionate about the product. Cultural fit interviews are there to weed out such people.

Take a look at Grokking the Behavioral Interview to learn more about questions that are typically asked during these interviews, and how best to navigate them.

Some of the basic rules of cultural fit interviews are:

Show interest in the product, and demonstrate an understanding of it. (I once had a candidate who told me that Facebook sells cloud services like AWS (Storage/Compute). He had even used one of those. Now, Facebook did buy Parse.com and kept it alive for a while, but Cloud Infrastructure was never Facebook’s primary/core business).

Be ready to describe scenarios where you had a conflict with your teammates or managers and how you resolved it. Please don’t say that you never had a conflict if you’ve been working as a software engineer for a few years.

Talk about what you want to accomplish in the company

Talk about some of your recent / most significant accomplishments as an engineer

Talk about some particularly crazy/difficult bugs that you encountered.
