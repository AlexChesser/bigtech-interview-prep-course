1. <https://triplebyte.com/iv/bYHlCkc/cp/header> (affifliate link) Last week we talked about companies using engineering test platforms to recruit, one of the best I've seen was TripleByte. That's an affiliate link but I genuinely think this platform is really good for getting your credentials listed and in front of companies that are recruiting.  They have a series of tests and quizzes for you to do that are *actually super hard* what's nice about the difficulty aspect of the quizzes is they accurately can separate users into tiers where you get a 5 point scale for a number of engineering domains.  High achievment on triplebyte (so they say) can get you straight to the front of the line for a lot of engineering roles.  If you don't do well on a quiz you can retake in 4-6 months, meaning you've got time to study and upgrade.  Strongly recommend this one.  Even without the affiliate link TBH feel free to type in the URL directly if the idea of me getting areferral bonus is distateful to you :)
