# WEEK 3: Heaps, Tries, Sorting, Searching

The topics at hand for the next two weeks are: Complexity Analysis (a.k.a BigO), Arrays, Stacks, Queues, Linked List, Trees, Tries, Graphs (BFS and DFS), Hash Tables, Heaps, Sorting, Searching

## Outstanding followup issues 

1. <https://triplebyte.com/iv/bYHlCkc/cp/header> (affifliate link) Last week we talked about companies using engineering test platforms to recruit, one of the best I've seen was TripleByte. That's an affiliate link but I genuinely think this platform is really good for getting your credentials listed and in front of companies that are recruiting.  They have a series of tests and quizzes for you to do that are *actually super hard* what's nice about the difficulty aspect of the quizzes is they accurately can separate users into tiers where you get a 5 point scale for a number of engineering domains.  High achievment on triplebyte (so they say) can get you straight to the front of the line for a lot of engineering roles.  If you don't do well on a quiz you can retake in 4-6 months, meaning you've got time to study and upgrade.  Strongly recommend this one.  Even without the affiliate link TBH feel free to type in the URL directly if the idea of me getting areferral bonus is distateful to you :)
1. **they tried to ban him** what's that one little secret employers hate?! Tune in to find out!
1. <https://btholt.github.io/four-semesters-of-cs/> from Rajat a text summary of the core CS concepts you're going to need for a tech career.
1. <https://cs50.harvard.edu/college/2021/spring/> probably the best CS refresher course out there. Incredible production value (they have muppets!)
1. <https://www.youtube.com/user/cs50tv> what's more - CS50 - has been running for years! There are easily hundreds of videos online. Especially nice are the "tracks" which are mini lectures in a series on a topic not covered by the main course.

## Learning Objectives

1. Have a borader understanding of the data structures we started on last week.
1. Have a plan for mapping each major data structure to a feature of your chosen language (don't make my mistake! don't sort in an interview!)
1. Have another round of thoughts on the behavioral interview
1. Get excited for next week's special guest!!!! Amy Miller <https://www.recruitinginyogapants.com/> tech recruiter who has worked directly with Google, Microsoft and, Amazon (kindof a big deal!)

## Discussion questions

1. Experience from another interview (and the lesson learned - make sure you map each data structure to an object in your language of choice)
